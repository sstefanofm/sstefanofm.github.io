        <p>Hi! JavaScript is the language that I&apos;ve spent most of my development career learning.</p>
        <p>
          Many things can be done with one-liners to look like a pro.
          And OOP in JS is a joke, and I love non object oriented languages.
        </p>
        <p>This section of my webpage is to show cool things made with this awesome language.</p>
